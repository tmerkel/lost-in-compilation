# Hello World

> There are so many things that you really should know, and that's why I'm bothering telling you so. - Dr. Seuss

I've written a whole lot of documentation for various jobs I've held...and I'm willing to bet the vast majority of them have had an intro page with that quote. I like it because I almost always start documenting things because there's no existing place to go to understand the team's systems, technologies, terminology, etc, and I like making sure that the people who join behind me have it better than I did...or that the existing team members have a starting point for unifying and clarifying understanding of things.

For me, that's what this site is. It's a place for me to write down my understanding of things I'm working on...for future me...and for others searching...for you.

And hopefully...you'll give me me some feedback on things that I didn't clarify well enough...or that you know better than I do. It's the best way for whatever is captured here to evolve.
