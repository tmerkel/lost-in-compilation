# Who am I...

My name is Travis Merkel. I currently work on things related to Kubernetes for [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com), but this site and any content is my own doing and my own opinions.

I started this site...well...mostly as a notepad for myself where I can share learnings with the world. I've come to realize blogging isn't really my style...but...I do a fair job at writing tech docs...

I'm interested in a wide variety of things...web dev, agile practices, devops things...and I'm happiest when I get to play across the stack and dabble in infra and automation.
